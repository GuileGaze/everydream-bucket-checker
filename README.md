# everydream-bucket-checker
Calculates buckets for EveryDream and displays each grouping

Execute the script, select the directory which contains your images (non-recursive), and set the batch size. The image file names will also be printed to the terminal.

**Note:** I didn't do any form of optimisation. It takes about 15 seconds to display 200 images so it probably isn't the most ideal for larger datasets.
